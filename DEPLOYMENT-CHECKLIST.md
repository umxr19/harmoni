# Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist to ensure your application is ready for deployment. Follow these steps before deploying to any environment.

## 1. Environment Configuration

- [ ] All required environment variables are set in `.env` files
- [ ] Different environment files exist for different environments:
  - [ ] `.env.development` for development
  - [ ] `.env.test` for testing
  - [ ] `.env.production` for production
- [ ] No sensitive information is hardcoded in the codebase
- [ ] API URLs are correctly configured for the target environment
- [ ] Frontend environment variables are set correctly

## 2. Code Quality

- [ ] All linting issues are resolved (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] TypeScript type errors are fixed
- [ ] No debug/console.log statements in production code
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Code is properly documented

## 3. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Frontend assets are minified
- [ ] Images are optimized
- [ ] Lazy loading is implemented for large components
- [ ] Bundle size is optimized
- [ ] Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
- [ ] API responses are cached where appropriate

## 4. Security

- [ ] Authentication system is properly tested
- [ ] API endpoints are secured with proper authorization
- [ ] Input validation is implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for sensitive endpoints
- [ ] No sensitive data is exposed in API responses
- [ ] Password reset functionality is tested

## 5. Database

- [ ] Database connection is tested
- [ ] Database indexes are created for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Database migrations are prepared (if applicable)
- [ ] Database backup strategy is in place
- [ ] Database credentials are secure and not hardcoded

## 6. Frontend

- [ ] Application is responsive on all target devices
- [ ] All links and navigation work correctly
- [ ] Forms submit correctly and validate inputs
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Loading states are implemented for async operations
- [ ] Browser compatibility is tested

## 7. Backend

- [ ] API endpoints return correct status codes
- [ ] Error handling is implemented for all endpoints
- [ ] Logging is configured properly
- [ ] API documentation is up to date
- [ ] Health check endpoint is implemented

## 8. DevOps

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is configured and tested
- [ ] Docker images build successfully
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration is tested
- [ ] Deployment scripts are tested
- [ ] Rollback strategy is defined
- [ ] Monitoring is configured

## 9. Final Checks

- [ ] Run the deployment checklist script: `node scripts/deployment-checklist.js`
- [ ] Test the application in a staging environment that mirrors production
- [ ] Verify all critical user flows work end-to-end
- [ ] Check for any performance issues under load
- [ ] Ensure all team members are aware of the deployment

## 10. Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify the application is running correctly in production
- [ ] Monitor for any errors or issues
- [ ] Check that database connections are working
- [ ] Verify that authentication is working
- [ ] Test critical user flows in production
- [ ] Monitor application performance

## Deployment Commands

### Development Deployment

```bash
# Build and start the application in development mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build and start the application in production mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Rollback Procedure

```bash
# Roll back to the previous version
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
git checkout <previous-version-tag>
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
