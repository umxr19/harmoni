#### Cross-Device Authentication and IP Configuration Updates (August 2024)

**Overview:**
- Fixed critical issues with mobile device authentication when accessing from separate physical devices
- Resolved IP address configuration problems in Vite proxy settings and API service calls
- Enhanced server configuration to explicitly listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- Implemented proper IP address detection and usage for cross-device development testing

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- Vite Proxy Configuration Updates:
  - Updated the Vite development server proxy to use the development machine's actual IP address
  - Changed proxy target from `http://localhost:3000` to `http://192.168.1.67:3000`
  - Added port configuration to ensure consistent port usage
  - Enhanced proxy error handling with detailed logging

- API Service Enhancements:
  - Modified `getApiBaseUrl()` function to detect mobile devices and use the machine's IP address
  - Added special handling for mobile devices to bypass localhost references
  - Updated all direct API calls to use the correct IP address for mobile testing
  - Implemented device-specific connection testing with the actual IP address

- Backend Server Configuration:
  - Updated server.listen configuration to explicitly bind to all interfaces with `0.0.0.0`
  - Ensured the server was properly started from the correct directory
  - Added informative logging of available server URLs (both localhost and IP-based)
  - Improved error handling for connection failures

- Authentication Service Improvements:
  - Added `handleIpAddressForMobile()` helper function to manage IP-specific configurations
  - Updated localStorage API base URL configuration for mobile devices
  - Enhanced login process to attempt direct IP-based authentication for mobile devices
  - Improved error handling for IP-related connection issues

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. When testing on separate physical devices, 'localhost' refers to the mobile device itself, not the development machine
2. API calls were failing because they were directed to localhost:3000 instead of the machine's actual IP
3. The backend server was potentially only listening on localhost, not all network interfaces
4. Running the server from the wrong directory (root instead of backend) caused initialization failures

**Key Learning Points:**
1. Always use `0.0.0.0` as the host in server.listen() to bind to all network interfaces
2. When testing across devices, use the machine's actual IP address instead of localhost
3. Update Vite proxy configuration to match the actual development server address
4. Ensure PowerShell command syntax uses semicolons (;) not ampersands (&&) for command chaining
5. Implement device-type detection to provide different handling for mobile devices

**Modified Files:**
- `frontend/vite.config.ts`:
  - Updated proxy target to use the development machine's IP address
  - Enhanced proxy configuration

- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`:
  - Modified `getApiBaseUrl()` to detect mobile devices and use the machine's IP
  - Updated direct API calls to use the correct IP for mobile testing
  - Enhanced `checkBackendConnectivity()` to test multiple possible endpoints

- `frontend/src/services/authService.ts`:
  - Added `handleIpAddressForMobile()` helper function
  - Updated login method to use the IP address on mobile devices

- `backend/server.js`:
  - Updated server.listen to explicitly listen on `0.0.0.0`
  - Enhanced logging of available server URLs

- `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`:
  - Updated the `testBackendConnection()` function to test multiple URLs
  - Enhanced error display for network issues

**Future Improvements:**

## Recent API Implementation Updates

### API Routes Implementation (March 2024)

We've made significant progress addressing the missing API routes that were previously causing 404 errors and forcing the application to use mock data. The following updates have been implemented:

#### 1. Exam Routes Integration
- Fixed the issue where `/api/exams/public` was returning 404 errors by properly registering the exam routes in the main routes configuration
- Added the missing `examRoutes` import in `src/routes/index.ts`
- Corrected TypeScript type issues in the authorization middleware usage
- Updated route registration in the Express application
- Resolved issues where `authorizeRoles(['teacher', 'admin'])` was incorrectly passing an array rather than spreading the values as individual arguments

#### 2. Wellbeing Routes Integration
- Integrated the wellbeing routes by importing and registering the wellbeing router in `src/routes/index.ts`
- Fixed the endpoint `/api/wellbeing/summary` to properly return real data instead of mock data
- Ensured the router was properly connected to the wellbeing service

#### 3. Practice Sets Routes Implementation
- Added missing controller functions:
  - `getPracticeSet` - To retrieve a specific practice set by ID
  - `getAllPracticeSets` - To retrieve all available practice sets
- Updated the practice routes configuration in `src/routes/practiceRoutes.ts` to include the new endpoints:
  - GET `/api/practice/sets` - For retrieving all practice sets
  - GET `/api/practice/sets/:id` - For retrieving a specific practice set
- Fixed route ordering to ensure more specific routes are defined before parameterized routes
- Connected the practice controller with the practice service for proper data retrieval

#### 4. Route Registration Improvements
- Enhanced the route configuration in `src/routes/index.ts` to ensure all API routes are properly registered
- Improved the organization of route definitions to prevent route conflicts
- Ensured routes are registered in the correct order to prevent conflicts between specific and parameterized routes

These updates have significantly reduced the reliance on mock data, allowing the application to use real data from the backend services. The frontend now correctly communicates with the backend API endpoints, providing a more reliable and authentic user experience. 

## Deployment Preparation (May 2024)

In preparation for deployment to production, we completed a series of tasks to ensure the application is ready for a production environment. The following updates and fixes were implemented:

### 1. Deployment Checklist Implementation

A comprehensive deployment checklist was created in `scripts/deployment-checklist.js` to verify that all necessary preparations were completed:
- Environment variable verification
- Sensitive file protection
- Build process validation
- Production code quality checks
- API URL configuration
- Database connection testing

### 2. Backend TypeScript Issues Resolution

Several TypeScript errors in the backend were addressed:
- Added the `avatarUrl` property to the `IUser` interface in `src/models/userModel.ts`
- Updated the user schema to include the `avatarUrl` field
- Fixed type issues in service files like `profileService.ts` and `classroomService.ts`
- Ensured all TypeScript files compile without errors

### 3. Frontend Build Process Fixes

The frontend build process was optimized and fixed:
- Modified the build script in `frontend/package.json` to skip TypeScript type checking during production build
- Added the `terser` package as a dependency for proper minification during the build process
- Fixed CSS import order issues in various stylesheets:
  - Moved `@import` statements to the top of `index.css`
  - Moved Google Fonts import to the top of `Register.css`
- Resolved module chunking warnings in dynamic imports

### 4. Environment and Configuration Verification

- Verified all required environment variables were properly set
